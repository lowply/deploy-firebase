 *     overwhelming if you only want to process a few messages at a time.
 *     Setting this option to false will make the client manage any excess
 *     messages until you're ready for them. This will prevent them from being
 *     redelivered and make the maxMessages option behave more predictably.
 * @property {number} [maxBytes=104857600] The desired amount of memory to
 *     allow message data to consume. (Default: 100MB) It's possible that this
 *     value will be exceeded, since messages are received in batches.
 * @property {number} [maxExtension=60] The maximum duration (in seconds)
 *      to extend the message deadline before redelivering.
 * @property {number} [maxMessages=1000] The desired number of messages to allow
 *     in memory before pausing the message stream. Unless allowExcessMessages
 *     is set to false, it is very likely that this value will be exceeded since
 *     any given message batch could contain a greater number of messages than
 *     the desired amount of messages.
